# SMS SPAN DETECTOR APPLICATION
This repository contains code for a SMS spam detector application.  The application uses python, sckikit-learn and Gradio.

The SMS Spam Dector application is designed to classify text messages as either spam or not spam.  It utilizes a SVC model
trained on a dataset of SMS messages.  The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text 
messages, and it retgurns a classification results indicating whether the message is likely spam or not.
The model's performance is based on the training data, and users can test the application with their own text 
messages to see the classificaiton outcome.

The files include:
1. gradio_sms_text_classification:  This Jupyter notebook contains the code for creating the Gradio interface and deploying.
2. sms_text_classification_solution:  This Jupyter notebook contains the solution for code for building a SVC model to classify messages.
3. SMSSpamCollection.CSV:  File contains the SMS dataset used for training and testing the model.

I was able to successfully run the gradio_sms_text_claffication.ipynb April 5th, 2024.
